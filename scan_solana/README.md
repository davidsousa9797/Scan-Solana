# Scan Solana

Scan Solana is a Python-based project developed for scanning and monitoring cryptoassets on the Solana blockchain. It leverages various libraries, API's and tools to provide a powerful toolkit against scam transactions and fraudulent activities.

## Pre-requisites

Also, please make sure you have a valid API key to use with DexTools.
## Goal

The goal of this project is to help foster trust and transparency in the world of blockchain and digital assets. We aim to help users make informed choices by evaluating new cryptocurrencies, pertinent data, and diligent research.

## How to Use

Run the main script and allow 10 minutes for the mongodb database with new_pairs to feed.
